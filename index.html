        <h2> ARCS Token (ARX) Utilities</h2>
        The ARX token offers a wide range of functions and value within the ARCS 2.0 ecosystem, creating
        attractive incentives for participants. The main utilities are as follows:
        <ul class="sub-head-list">
            <li>Real Estate Investment and Operation</li>
            <li>Payments for Travel, Accommodation, Dining, etc.</li>
            <li>Subscription Benefits</li>
            <li>Staking</li>
            <li>Trading</li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li class="sub-head">Real Estate Investment and Operation</li>
            <p>ARX is the key to making investment in Real World Assets (RWA) like real estate more familiar and
                accessible. It may be utilized to purchase or fractionally own real estate and to receive dividends
                based on
                that ownership. This gives users the opportunity to own a part of a real estate portfolio from a small
                amount
                and enjoy profits from rental income or appreciation in property value.</p>
            <li class="sub-head">Payments for Travel, Accommodation, Dining, etc.</li>
            <p>As the core payment method of the ecosystem, ARX can be used for payments at accommodation facilities
                operated by the SSG Group, as well as at affiliated restaurants and activity centers. Payments with ARX
                are
                subject to more favorable discount rates or special cashbacks than fiat currency, allowing users to
                enjoy
                direct economic benefits by "using" the token.</p>
            <li class="sub-head">Subscription Benefits</li>
            <p>ARX serves as a testament to loyalty to the ecosystem. By holding or staking a certain amount of ARX,
                users can obtain a special membership status. This status grants them exclusive benefits that serve as
                an
                incentive for continuous holding, such as priority booking rights for exclusive properties not available
                to the
                public, higher discount rates, and invitations to special events.</p>
            <li class="sub-head">Staking</li>
            <p>Users can contribute to the stability of the ecosystem's network by locking up (staking) their ARX for a
                certain period, earning additional ARX as a reward. This not only stabilizes the token's supply and
                demand
                balance but also provides users with an attractive opportunity to generate income from their holdings.
            </p>
            <li class="sub-head">Trading</li>
            <p>ARX can be traded with other cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies on affiliated cryptocurrency exchanges.
                The growth of the ecosystem, the expansion of the real estate portfolio, and the increase in the user
                base
                can have a direct impact on the market value of ARX, giving participants the opportunity to share in the
                success of the ecosystem.
